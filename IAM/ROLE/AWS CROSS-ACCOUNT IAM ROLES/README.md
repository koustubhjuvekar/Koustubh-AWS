## üöÄ AWS Cross-Account IAM Role (Vendor Developer Access)

## üß† Question
Your company **StarCloud (Admin account: Koustubh-Admin)** hires an external vendor company **WeDevelop**.  
WeDevelop assigns their developer **Monica** to work temporarily in your AWS account to:

- Launch and configure an EC2 instance  
- Develop a PHP-based web page and upload files to S3  
- Access S3 to verify the uploaded data  

You want **Monica** to have this access for only **5 hours**, after which her access should automatically expire.

---

## üè¢ Scenario Explanation (Professional Context)

This is a real-world **cross-account collaboration model**.  
In cloud-based projects, companies often invite external vendors or freelancers to develop, configure, or test applications within their AWS environment.  

To do this securely, instead of sharing credentials, the company creates a **temporary cross-account IAM role**.

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Your account (StarCloud)** | Acts as the *Resource Owner / Admin Account* |
| **Vendor account (WeDevelop)** | Acts as the *Trusted Account* |
| **Developer Monica** | IAM user in WeDevelop who assumes the role you provide |
| **Temporary access** | Automatically expires after the role session ends (5 hours) |

### ‚úÖ This ensures:
- No permanent credentials are shared  
- You control what Monica can do (e.g., only EC2 + S3)  
- Access auto-expires after 5 hours (session duration)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### **A. Steps in Your Account ‚Äî StarCloud (Admin Account)**

#### 1. Create a Role
- Console ‚Üí **IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create role**
- Select **Another AWS account**
- Enter **WeDevelop‚Äôs AWS Account ID** (Monica‚Äôs account ID)

  -  Another AWS account - Account ID - `982081044537`

- Click **Next**

<br>


#### 2. Attach Policies
Attach the following AWS managed policies:
- `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
- `AmazonS3FullAccess`

#### 3. Set Session Duration
Under **Maximum session duration**, choose **5 hours (18,000 seconds)**.

#### 4. Review and Create Role

- **Role name:** `WeDevelopMonicaRole`
- **Description** - `This role is created for development, for Monica at WeDevelop Company.`

<img width="1350" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e865c899-0f22-40dc-b409-eda86fd42de5" />
<br>

- Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí  `WeDevelopMonicaRole`
- Note the **Role ARN**, for example:

  -  `arn:aws:iam::494341429801:role/WeDevelopMonicaRole`

- Now Scroll down ‚Üí Go to **`Trust relationships`** ‚Üí Edit trust policy ‚Üí 

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::982081044537:user/Monica.developer"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "DateLessThan": {
          "aws:CurrentTime": "2025-10-18T17:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```


#### 5. (Optional) Add Condition for Expiry Based on Date/Time
To make sure access is valid only for 5 hours from now (e.g., till `2025-10-18T17:00:00Z`):

```json
"Condition": {
  "DateLessThan": {
      "aws:CurrentTime": "2025-10-18T17:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

This ensures that after this time, even if Monica re-assumes the role, it won‚Äôt work.

## üß© Trust Policy in IAM Role ‚Äî Explanation Notes

---

### üß† What is a Trust Policy?

A **trust policy** defines **who is allowed to assume a role**.

It establishes a **trust relationship** between the **role owner account** (your AWS account) and the **trusted entity** (another AWS account, IAM user, or service).

In a **cross-account scenario**, it allows users from another AWS account to **access your resources temporarily** via `sts:AssumeRole`.

---

### üí° Why Do We Add a Trust Policy?

When you create a role, **no one can assume it by default**.

To enable a specific **external account or IAM user** (like *Monica* from *WeDevelop*), you must **explicitly define that trust** in the role‚Äôs trust policy.

This ensures that access is:
- ‚úÖ Secure  
- ‚úÖ Controlled  
- ‚úÖ Limited only to the entities you specify

---

### üßæ What Does the Trust Policy Contain?

A trust policy includes these key fields:

| **Field** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-------------|
| `"Effect": "Allow"` | Grants permission to assume the role |
| `"Principal"` | Defines *who* can assume the role (user, account, or service) |
| `"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"` | Allows the principal to perform the `AssumeRole` API call |
| `"Condition"` | *(Optional)* Adds extra security, like time-based expiry or MFA requirement |

---

### üë§ Why Are We Using `"Principal"`?

`"Principal"` identifies the **trusted entity** that is allowed to assume the role.

In this case, the trusted entity is **Monica** ‚Äî an IAM user in the **WeDevelop** account.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::982081044537:user/Monica.developer"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

### üß© Why Are We Adding Monica‚Äôs ARN Here?

Monica‚Äôs **ARN** uniquely identifies her IAM user across AWS.  

By using her ARN, we ensure that **only she** (not the entire WeDevelop account or other users) can assume the role.  

This is a **fine-grained security approach** ‚Äî access is tied to a **single trusted identity**, not a whole account.  

---

### ‚è≥ Why Add the Time-Based Condition?

To automatically **expire the trust after a specific UTC time**.  

This ensures **temporary access** ‚Äî even if Monica tries to re-assume the role later, AWS denies it.  

**Example condition:**
```json
"Condition": {
  "DateLessThan": {
    "aws:CurrentTime": "2025-10-18T17:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

---

### **B. Steps in WeDevelop Account (Monica‚Äôs Account)**

#### 1. Create IAM User Monica

- Go to **IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add user**
- **Username:** `Monica`
- Provide **Console access** (or **Programmatic access** if using CLI)
- Keep remainin as it is, simply create user.

#### 2. Attach Policy to Allow AssumeRole
Attach a **custom policy** allowing `sts:AssumeRole` on your role ARN:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/WeDevelopMonicaRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
