### **IAM**

- IAM is the only service by aws which is fully free.
- Go to IAM console.
- Here remember one thing, before IAM learning we were using root user to log in AWS console. In real life scenario, that root user account would be a company, then owner or founder may open account using email, log in AWS using root id.

- Then he/she create 1 (more if need) Admin account which will have full access of everyting, a highly authorized person.
- And the will sign out from root account. That root account would never be used again to log into AWS cosole. Everything will be worked or managed by Admin.
- Then root id would be used only and only if,  only needed for specific tasks like:
    -  Changing the account email or password
    -  Closing the AWS account
    -  Managing payment methods & tax settings
    -  Restoring IAM user permissions if accidentally locked out <br>

<img width="1351" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0576b82-78c9-444b-a5e3-6d733322ca46" /><br>

- Go to **Users** ‚Üí <kbd>Create user</kbd>

**User details**

-  **User name:** You‚Äôre creating a new IAM user called Koustubh_Admin. (This will be the account name for login/programmatic access).

-  Provide user access to the AWS Management Console ‚Äì _optional_:
   -  If you tick this, **the user will be able to log in to the AWS Console (web login).**
   -  If unchecked ‚Üí **the user can only access AWS using access keys (CLI/SDK).**


**Are you providing console access to a person?**

Here AWS asks how you want to manage console login (web login).

**Specify a user in Identity Center ‚Äì Recommended ‚úÖ**

   -  Best practice (especially for companies).
   -  Instead of creating many IAM users, AWS recommends using IAM Identity Center (previously AWS SSO).
   -  Advantage: Centralized login, easier user management, better security.
Example: In a company, all employees log in using their company email via Identity Center, not separate IAM users. <br>

**I want to create an IAM user**

   -  Traditional way of creating a user.
   -  You choose this if you specifically need an IAM user (for programmatic access, admin user, testing, or emergency access). <br>
Example: You are making Koustubh_Admin as an IAM admin user.


<img width="1351" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd6f449b-15e8-44dc-b9a4-c1291b4f7645" />

Here, First we want to create an ADMIN account and then sign out from root. So select `**I want to create IAM user.**`

Set password, here we set `Password@123`

<img width="1352" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcf0ac0f-21f9-461d-98ab-97aa68ff7795" />

??? Users must create a new password at next sign-in - Recommended . WHY?

Answer: It forces the user to set their own password on first login, improving security. <br>
Example: If any illegal or unauthorized activity happens from that account, the user cannot deny it because only they knew the new password ‚Äî ensures accountability and integrity.
<br>

Click on <kbd>**Next**</kbd>

<img width="1351" height="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/418ce9ac-73dd-4fb0-9db8-ba81621b5432" />

We will create user group later but select this option.
OR there you can see option to create group, you can click on that also and give group name and add permission.

_Following image is just to show if you click on create group, how it will look like. Close the window and continue to create IAM user_
<img width="1352" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/583b97c3-af66-4400-8ba2-4de1b4857082" />

Here I will create user group later.

??? Set permissions boundary - optional ==> It sets the maximum limit of permissions an IAM user or role can have ‚Äî even if other policies give more access, they can‚Äôt exceed this boundary.

Click on <kbd>**Next**</kbd>

<img width="1352" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45738cdd-32d7-4c68-9f95-1afe26451baf" />

Click on <kbd>**Create user**</kbd>

<img width="1366" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1beee37-34fc-4a9f-a367-d5385d7181eb" />

Here, <br>
username and first default password, for login will be displayed.
Also login link is there. You can pin or bookmark this link to log in directly to your account on daily basis, then you don't need to click here and there.
Copy link and save or bookmark OR you can find this link later, no worries.

If you see carefully this link contains AWS account id there. 
`https://494341429801.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`
See in image.

<img width="1366" height="43" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ce74e3-804b-4d57-a870-384b231717a0" />

<!--now this is ROOT account or Company account, so only id there.
So from now onwards, when you create IAM users or federated users, this account id will be act as domain for everyone.
for example: prajakta@494341429801
koustubh@494341429801
<anyuser@awsaccount> -->
So now you are logged in as root account, so root id or your name will be there. Later when you sign in using IAM, you will see your username below account id.

NOw here,

üìò Explaining `Email Sign-in Instructions` in IAM

Now, here I am the Admin, so I already know my username, password, and sign-in link.
But suppose I am the Company Owner and Admin, and I want to create individual IAM login IDs and passwords for my employees ‚Äî each with permissions based on their specific role and requirements.

The question is:
üëâ How can I inform them about their IAM login credentials?

When you create a new IAM user, you‚Äôll notice an option called `Email sign-in instructions.`
If you click this option, your default email app will automatically open with a pre-filled email template containing the AWS sign-in link, username, and instructions for the new user.

You just need to:

-    Enter the employee‚Äôs registered email address (the one they use in your organization).
-    Review or modify the message if needed.
-    Send the mail ‚Äî the employee will receive all their IAM login details.

Example:

E.g. Here I am sending mail from my one account to another account.
Suppose Main account OR ROOT account(current AWS) : <br>
```
Name : Koustubh
Account ID : 494341429801
Email : maverick******@gmail.com
```
I created a ADMIN account for CEO of the company with full authorization. I want to send him his IAM login credentials. Later I will log out from AWS as a root, Koustubh will handle all AWS as he is ADMINISTRATOR.
So his details
```
Name : Koustubh Juvekar
Account ID : <No need>
Email : koustubhjuvekar07@gmail.com
```

Then, by clicking ‚ÄúEmail sign-in instructions‚Äù, a ready-made email opens automatically ‚Äî you just send it to the CEO‚Äôs email (koustubhjuvekar07@gmail.com).
After that, you (the root user) log out, and the Admin user (Koustubh Juvekar) will handle all AWS operations from now on.

‚úÖ In short:
The ‚ÄúEmail sign-in instructions‚Äù option is an easy way to share IAM user login details securely via email. It helps ensure each employee receives their personalized AWS console login information directly.

See in the image what happens when I click on `Email sign-in instructions`

<img width="1366" height="726" alt="emailw" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29ac9371-6a2e-4a88-9077-63dc87ed89a5" />

Now Koustubh(New user) will receive email like this

<img width="1366" height="647" alt="emailw1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7003f9d-b196-443f-8e1a-fdb80bd2b22e" />

So here we created IAM ADMIN user successfully.
Now we have to create Users group for him. So that we need to give him permission. So let's create Users group.

Click on <kbd>Return to users list</kbd>

<img width="1366" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43ec1fe9-deb8-4e45-8f62-006fcea21736" />


## USER GROUPS

Users Group (in IAM) ‚Äì in short:

A group is a collection of IAM users.
You assign permissions or policies to the group, and all users in that group automatically get those permissions.

Example:

Group: `Developers` ‚Üí Policy: `EC2FullAccess` <br>
All users in the Developers group can manage EC2 instances.

Here I will create `ADMINS` group, and I will apply policies and permissions to **GROUP** and then whoever I want as an ADMIN, I will add them in this group.
So all the permissions and policies will be applied to them automatically.

So 

Go to User groups ‚Üí Click on <kbd>Create group</kbd>

User group name : `ADMINS` <br>
Add users to the group - Optional : Created users list will be there ‚Üí select user <br>
`Koustubh-admin`

Attach permissions policies - Optional : There are thousands of permissions policies

Select those you want to apply to group.

Here we are creating group of `ADMINS` so they should have full permissions policies.

So select `AdministratorAccess` - This permissions policy have full authorization of AWS services and account.

<img width="1351" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2a8d5ab-f39f-4715-b466-5ee96c6d7506" />

<img width="1350" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b52629-88c2-41b7-98ba-3cf9b5744207" />

Click on <kbd>**Create user group**</kbd>

<img width="1366" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9a63c9b-2ac2-4e63-b37b-d21c3518cda9" />

Now if you click on `ADMINS` and go in details, check for permission and click on `+` sign. You will get even JSON format of policy link

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

<img width="1350" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00f76922-9125-4ca9-9d9d-4cbcadf5cdc7" />

Okay Done!!!!!!!!!

So here an owner created 1 root account on AWS for company.<br>
For security and operations, owner created 1 ADMIN account using IAM user.<br>
Created 1 user group `ADMIN` for admins of the company who have full authorization of whole AWS.<br>
Added that IAM user to group. <br>
Now Owner logs out from ROOT account.<br>

So let's log in using IAM credentials received on mail.

Click on the link you received on mail or as previously said, you might have bookmarked it.
`https://494341429801.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`

Enter Username. Here `Koustubh-admin`<br>
Enter password. Here `Password@123`

<kbd>Sign in</kbd>

<img width="1350" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95de7da5-08aa-4255-9ba7-ec3b14640da2" />
<br>

You will see `Password reset` window. Because as a ADMIN I am logging first time.

So fill the details, set new password.

<img width="1350" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ac4924b-1dac-4293-a814-d64af1ecad57" />

<kbd>**Confirm password change**</kbd>

<img width="1366" height="645" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd21634-9f3c-475c-9ab7-0f2111074d35" />

Now you will be logged in to your AWS account as ADMIN, with full authorization.

<img width="1350" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0508f39e-7eed-41a5-9fa2-795e01404124" />

Now as ADMIN we have full access!!

So let's create 2 more users for different roles and give them only required access.

So let's create 

```
1st user: (To handle EC2 only)
User: Virat.ec2
User Group: EC2_Team_Leaders

2nd user: (To handle s3 only)
User: Sachin.s3
User Group: s3_Team_Leaders
```

<img width="1352" height="587" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09edc5be-0ca6-4213-a6c5-0a1468efbccc" />

<img width="1352" height="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/859d318d-3421-4199-8202-74039f2bc2f6" />

<img width="1351" height="589" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad02b774-4bdb-4802-8584-eb7c0c7994e9" />

Create user!!!

Similarly create user for s3
_(Here, we are logging in every account for testing, in real life when ADMIN mail them details, employee logs in their system with credentials, and then changes password and use it every day.)_

<img width="1348" height="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4b4c7b-4479-43ae-a307-fbdf6ce4f603" />

<img width="1352" height="541" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7daf006-8196-4fc0-8f8b-21baafa5f309" />

Every time we create group later seperately like previous practicals. This time let's create here in process.<br>
So in second page after above, click on <kbd>Create user</kbd>

<img width="1366" height="592" alt="s3user" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a6e38f5-d668-45eb-8f8d-f11bc204fb45" />

Enter here group name `s3_Team_Leaders` .<br>
He is Team leader for s3 team, so he needs to have full access of s3, so search for policy `AmazonS3FullAccess`.
When we apply only this policy, Sachin will get full access of `s3 service` only, nothing else.

Click on <kbd>Create user group</kbd>

Now select the group.

<img width="1350" height="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb3e32d-d9c6-4447-9db5-b84b45761cd8" />

Create user!!!

SO here 2 users created, just consider we mailed them their credentials.

NOw for trial, for s3 we created user and user group too, in ongoing process, <br>
but for ec2, let's create `EC2_Team_Leaders` group and assign `Virat.ec2` to it!

<img width="1358" height="589" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2ae0438-9b46-4f1e-bfa5-6421c76ded1e" />

Similary like Sachin, here Virat is Team leader for EC2 team, so he needs to have full access of EC2, so search for policy `AmazonEC2FullAccess`.
When we apply only this policy, Virat will get full access of `EC2 service` only, nothing else.

<img width="1351" height="588" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7118b91-52f9-4d8a-998f-60d2ebfc4c49" />

<img width="1351" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acbeec92-42ff-41c8-be22-2e34632adf5d" />

Create user group!!

Time for testing, so log out from ADMIN account and first let's try to log in as `Virat`.

Remember, account id will be same for all the accounts, because it is root account or you can say company's account. All the accounts comes under this account. So for login link will be same.

`https://494341429801.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`

**EC2_Team_Leader**
```
username : Virat.ec2
default password : Virat@123
```
<img width="1350" height="645" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e56d870e-9713-48c3-a0ab-5e35ee53092e" />

First time login, change password and click on next, get logged in successfully!

<img width="1348" height="646" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a9f672-3c67-4739-b994-ac7e2d22463a" />

<img width="1352" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f199dcb-8c9d-49fc-a964-afc993e93285" />

see, in right up corner logged in as IAM user we created for EC2 i.e. `Virat.ec2`

So we tried to launch an EC2 and it is launched successfully! All other operations related EC2, can be done!

Let's go to s3 service, from `Virat.ec2` account to check whether is it available for Virat or not.

So go to s3 console ‚Üí tried to create bucket, you will see following error that is `access denied`

<img width="1349" height="637" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/831aa718-450e-495b-b3d5-4ca0d9bd1b54" />

<img width="1353" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e65aba8c-674a-4bf3-bd99-ac1ecbec1641" />

So here we proved that, Virat has only access to EC2 services, other accesses are denied, we did it using IAM.

Log out from Virat's account and log in using `Sachin`'s Account. Create 1 s3 bucket. That will be successfully created. 

Then go to EC2 from same login and try to launch EC2, you won't be able to launch EC2. Try other services also, you won't be able to use anything besides `s3` only.

See, for Sachin all accesses are denied.

<img width="1350" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d27003-4bcc-480b-a922-939a0d97841d" />

<br>

<img width="1354" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95a63fd3-a95e-4d6c-87da-c57911f973f7" />

Now go to `s3` console and create 1 bucket. It's successfully created!

<img width="1350" height="636" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ffa17f1-9c47-47bc-8756-a75a7f4da977" />

Now Policies have 2 types:

```
               +----->   1. AWS Managed Policies
               | 
Policies ------|
               |
               +----->   2. Customer Managed Policies (Custom Managed Policies)
```

1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Managed Policies

 -    These are predefined policies created and maintained by AWS.
 -    They cover common use cases like AmazonS3FullAccess, AdministratorAccess, etc.
 -    You can directly attach them to users, groups, or roles ‚Äî no need to create your own.
 -    Benefit: Automatically updated by AWS when new permissions or services are added.<br>
Example:
```
Policy Name: AmazonEC2FullAccess
Purpose: Grants full access to EC2 resources.
```

üü© In short:

Ready-made policies managed and updated by AWS for common tasks.
<br>

<img width="1352" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eadfc2cf-16d9-4c0b-9e56-6f09eb302ad5" />
<br>


2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Managed Policies (Custom Managed Policies)

 -    These are policies you create and manage yourself in your AWS account.
 -    Useful when AWS Managed Policies don‚Äôt exactly fit your organization‚Äôs needs.
 -    You define permissions in JSON format and can reuse them across multiple users, groups, or roles.
Example:
```
Policy Name: DevEC2LimitedAccess
Purpose: Allows EC2 start/stop only for development instances.
```
üü© In short:

User-created policies tailored to specific needs ‚Äî fully managed by you.
<br>

<img width="1366" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03665538-bf20-4bde-9f71-a472155f663e" />
<br>

### **Task ‚Äì Custom IAM Policy Example**

-    Scenario:

Virat (IAM user) ‚Äî `Virat.ec2`

Already has full EC2 access through the EC2FullAccess policy.

Now we want to give him limited S3 access ‚Äî only Read and List permissions.

let's write our own policy. 

üü¢ Points about Principal in IAM Policies

-    Principal means "who" gets the permission.
     -    Example: A specific user, role, or AWS account.

-    In IAM policies, Principal is not used.
-    Because IAM policies are identity-based ‚Äî they‚Äôre directly attached to users, groups, or roles.
So, AWS already knows who the permissions belong to.

-    Resource-based policies (like S3, SNS, Lambda) must include Principal.
-    Here you explicitly mention who can access the resource.

**IAM identity-based policies** are the only policies **without Principal.**
Permissions automatically apply to the identity they‚Äôre attached to.

### -    Steps:

1.    Click on <kbd>Create policy</kbd>

2.    There will be 2 ways to create policies --> Visual and JSON

3.    So Visual means by selecting options and JSON means writing in code. So let's try first using visual.

4.    Now here we are creating policy for `s3` so select `s3` from **`Service`**

<img width="1350" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cce8cec0-9457-4e21-813d-6d7f35666c5d" />
<br>

5.    AWS has already given multiple actions lists there, select which actions being performed under your policy as you want.

6.    Now here, we are going to write policy **ONLY TO READ AND LIST s3 BUCKET** and apply to `EC2_Team_Leaders` group.

7.    So select `All list actions` and `All read actions`

8.    Scroll down and go to **Resources**
      -    Here you will see list of all resources which comes under s3 service. So if you want to specify specific resource then you can select specific one.
      -    Here we select `All resources`

<img width="1351" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d19ba0a-ebaa-474f-a881-274b5b0c06e9" />
<br>

9.    Click on <kbd>Next</kbd>.

10.   Give Policy name and description

      -    Policy name : `S3ReadListPolicy`
      -    Description : `Just to READ and LIST from s3`
   
11.    Then **Create Policy**

<img width="1350" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2aa06c-d2f5-412e-b439-737b5883d937" />
<br>

<img width="1350" height="594" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b434df6c-5bea-4573-a909-6fabd0a30f3a" />
<br>

12.    Now go to **User groups**

13.    Click on `EC2_Team_Leaders` ‚Üí Go to `Permissions`  ‚Üí   Click on <kbd> Add Permissions </kbd>

14.    Click on **Attach policies** = _Here we can attach already created policies. As in this case..._
       -    There is another option **Create inline policies** = _Here we write policy directly in JSON and attach on the spot._
   
<img width="1350" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21633bf-72ff-4f30-9f80-6405262c8495" />
<br>

15.    Search few keywords of your created policies, so you can find it. Here `S3ReadListPolicy`
   
<img width="1366" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88511afc-584f-459f-9806-addd2867deff" />
<br>

16.    Select `S3ReadListPolicy` from list.

17.    Now click on <kbd>**Attach policies**</kbd>

Now you can see, for user group `EC2_Team_Leaders` will have 2 **Permission policies**

1.    `AmazonEC2FullAccess` ‚Üí IAM Permission with default
2.    `S3ReadListPolicy` ‚Üí Customer created policy, that we just created and attached.

<img width="1351" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b266b64-bf15-477f-8bda-51d779bef2fa" />
<br>

### _Time for testing..._

Log out from `Koustubh-admin` account and let's login using `Virat.ec2` account.

Now go to `s3`, you would see **List of buckets and other services there**

If you remember, previously it was not displayed for `Virat.ec2` because he had no permissions, but as we updated custome policies, bucket is visible.

<img width="1366" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc38d96-ae0f-4d61-97ea-522ca8063b8d" />
<br>

Now again, you can only `READ` and `LIST` resources or buckets or objects in the bucket.  _**You Can't create bucket or upload object in the bucket.**_

It will deny access! Want to check? See this...

If you go inside the bucket here `trial-bucket-koustubh` and try to upload an image (Object) - It will also deny access...

So here we created **Customer created policy** nad tested in the environment!!!

### Question: If there is a need that employees/users under `s3_Team_Leaders` need EC2 services for some reason. But they should not be able to **Terminate or edit** EC2 servers. How can you protect this?

Answer:     

-    You can use and apply the permission policies, using IAM. Just as we did before, only `READ` and `LIST` permissions. This is the best approach, because you don't need to apply individually, direct apply to group.

-    Another way is to **_Turn on Termination protection in EC2_**. But it needs to set this individually per EC2. So if you have 1000 EC2s, it's practically impossible. So ABove given approach is correct and feasible.    


--> Whatever policy you write, it should not go above size **64kb**
--> Only 6144 whitespaces allowed.

### ‚ùì Q: If an IAM policy reaches the 64 KB size limit, can we write only Deny statements instead of listing all Allow actions?

‚úÖ Answer:
Yes.
If most actions are allowed and only a few need to be restricted, it‚Äôs better to write only the Deny statements.
In IAM, everything is denied by default, and explicit Deny always overrides any Allow.
So by writing a small Deny policy, you can stay within the 64 KB limit and still enforce security effectively.

**Example:**
-    Instead of writing 500 Allow actions and 5 Deny actions,
-    you can just write a policy with those 5 Deny actions ‚Äî
-    all other permissions remain allowed by the broader (existing) policy.

Explicit Deny overrides Allow (Allow + Deny ==> Deny ‚úÖ)
‚Üí If a user has both ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeny‚Äù for the same action, Deny always takes precedence.

Full access overrides partial access (Full access + Half access ==> Full access ‚úÖ)
‚Üí If one policy grants full access and another grants limited access, the full access remains effective, unless a Deny exists.

By default, all requests are denied. (Default all ==> Deny ‚ùå)
‚Üí A user starts with no permissions. You must explicitly Allow access.

Explicit Allow overrides default Deny
‚Üí Once you add an Allow in a policy, it grants access‚Äîunless a Deny explicitly blocks it.

### `ROLES`

-    ROLE is used to avoid secret key and access key.
-    Used for temporary access.
-    When we work in AWS, even though we do not create role purposefully, AWS create few roles in backend.

üé≠ Who Can Use IAM Roles?

üßë‚Äçüíª 1. Human Users (Federated or Temporary Access)

-    Roles can be given to users who sign in through identity providers (IdPs) like:
-    AWS SSO, Google, or Active Directory.

These users assume roles temporarily ‚Äî no need for IAM user credentials.
-    Use case: An employee from another organization accesses your AWS account via a role.


ü§ñ 2. Machines (AWS Services)

-    AWS services like EC2, Lambda, ECS, or CodeBuild can assume roles.

This allows them to securely call other AWS services without storing keys.
-    Use case: An EC2 instance uploads data to S3 using its attached IAM Role.

üíª 3. Programs / Applications

-    External apps or scripts can assume roles using AWS STS (Security Token Service).

They get temporary credentials (AccessKey, SecretKey, SessionToken).
-    Use case: A Python script running on-premises assumes a role to access AWS.

-    ROLE created for default 1 hr, maximum 12hrs from AWS site. If you want more then using coding you can increase upto for 36hrs.
-    Can be applied to system, human and application


üß† 169.254.169.254 ‚Äî What It Is

‚úÖ It is a special IP address used inside AWS (and other clouds) for Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).

When you launch an EC2 instance, it automatically gets this internal IP, which is not accessible from the internet.
It‚Äôs used by the instance itself to get information about its configuration.

üß© What You Can Get from It

From inside an EC2 instance, if you run:

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/


You can get details like:

-    Instance ID
-    Instance type
-    Private IP
-    IAM role attached
-    Security group
-    Region, AZ, etc.

üîí Why It‚Äôs Important

-    Used for temporary credentials when an IAM role is attached to an EC2 instance.

-    Helps EC2 authenticate securely to AWS services without using access keys.
